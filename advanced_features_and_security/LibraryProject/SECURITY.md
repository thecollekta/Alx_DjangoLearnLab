## XSS Protection

- Input fields and URL parameters were tested for XSS vulnerabilities. All scripts were sanitized or rendered as plain text, indicating that XSS protection is effective.

## SQL Injection Protection

- Search fields were tested using sqlmap for SQL injection vulnerabilities. No vulnerabilities were detected, confirming that queries are properly parameterized.

## CSP Testing
