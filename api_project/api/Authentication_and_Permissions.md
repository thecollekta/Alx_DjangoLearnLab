# Configuring Authentication and Permissions in Django REST Framework

## 1. Brief Explanation: Configuring Authentication and Permissions in Django REST Framework

**Authentication and Permissions in DRF** are essential for securing API endpoints and controlling access to resources based on the user's identity and roles.

### Steps to Configure Authentication and Permissions:

1. **Install Token Authentication:**
   - Add `rest_framework.authtoken` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.
   - Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the necessary tables for token management.

2. **Configure DRF Settings:**
   - Update `settings.py` to include token authentication:

     ```python
     REST_FRAMEWORK = {
         'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
             'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
         ),
         'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
             'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
         ),
     }
     ```

3. **Token Retrieval Endpoint:**
   - Enable or create an endpoint where users can obtain their token by sending their username and password. This is usually done using DRFâ€™s `obtain_auth_token` view:

     ```python
     from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
     from django.urls import path

     urlpatterns = [
         path('api-token-auth/', obtain_auth_token, name='api_token_auth'),
     ]
     ```

4. **Set Permissions:**
   - Apply permissions to your views using DRF's built-in or custom permission classes, such as `IsAuthenticated` or `IsAdminUser`:

     ```python
     from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

     class BookViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
         queryset = Book.objects.all()
         serializer_class = BookSerializer
         permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
     ```

## 2. Demonstration: How It Works in Your API Setup

### Testing the Configuration:

1. **Obtain Authentication Token:**
   - Use Postman or `curl` to send a POST request to the token retrieval endpoint with the user's credentials:

     ```zsh
     curl -X POST -d "username=user1&password=password123" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api-token-auth/
     ```

   - This returns a token that the user will include in the Authorization header for future requests.

2. **Accessing an API Endpoint with Authentication:**
   - With the obtained token, access an API endpoint by including it in the Authorization header:

     ```zsh
     curl -H "Authorization: Token <your_token>" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/
     ```

   - This request will succeed only if the token is valid and the user has the necessary permissions.

3. **Testing Without Authentication:**
   - Try accessing the same endpoint without the token to see how the API rejects unauthorized requests:

     ```zsh
     curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/
     ```

   - This request will be denied with a 401 Unauthorized status, demonstrating that authentication and permissions are properly enforced.
